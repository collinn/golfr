As I reach the final day of the project, it is clear that there have been both significant achievements and notable challenges, each offering valuable lessons for future endeavors. One of the most rewarding aspects of this project was the opportunity to learn and apply new functions and tools. The use of new functions like `lapply` and `Reduce` opened up new ways to handle data efficiently in R, making the coding process both enlightening and enjoyable. Additionally, gaining familiarity with GitHub and its features, such as using Git Bash and understanding how branches work, was very beneficial. These skills are not only crucial for this project but also for any future collaborative coding work.

A positive outcome of the project was the personal connection developed with the professor. Having never taken a class with him before, this project provided a platform to interact and learn from his expertise. His insights and guidance were significant in navigating through the project’s challenges and enhancing my understanding of both the technical and conceptual aspects of the work. Furthermore, the sense of accomplishment and joy when the code functioned correctly and met the intended objectives was deeply satisfying. It was a reaffirmation of the effort put into understanding and solving complex problems, and it underscored the intrinsic pleasure of coding and problem-solving.

Despite these successes, the project was not without its difficulties. A significant challenge arose when I found myself comparing my progress and abilities to those of my project partner. This comparison led to feelings of inadequacy and demotivation, making it difficult to maintain a positive outlook on my contributions. The sense of being 'useless' was a heavy burden, affecting both my productivity and well-being. However, I did not face this challenge alone. By reaching out to both the professor and a counselor, I received the support and perspective needed to overcome these feelings. The professor’s empathy and shared experiences were particularly comforting, as he acknowledged my progress and potential. The counselor’s guidance helped me reflect on the validity of comparing myself to someone with a broader academic background and more experience in computer science. These conversations helped me recognize and appreciate my own efforts and progress.

Looking ahead, the project will continue with a focus on refining the basic function for group assignments, ensuring that the same students are not grouped together more than once. Once this core functionality is done, the next step will be to introduce more customization options. For example, developing functions that group students based on their test scores or other criteria can add significant value and flexibility to the tool. These enhancements will make the package more versatile and applicable to a wider range of educational settings.

On the other hand, there are several areas where I can improve. First and foremost is time management. Striking a balance between work and well-being is crucial. Setting strict boundaries between work hours and personal time will help maintain mental health and prevent burnout. Another area for improvement is creating a better working environment. While working outside has its benefits, I found that working from home often provided a more conducive and comfortable space for focusing on complex tasks.

In conclusion, this project has been a journey of both professional and personal growth. While there were challenges, particularly related to self-comparison and motivation, the support system in place and the learning opportunities far outweighed the difficulties. Moving forward, with a continued focus on enhancing the functionality of the group assignment tool and an emphasis on better time management and working conditions, I am confident in the positive outcome of this research. This experience has not only broadened my technical skills but also taught me invaluable lessons about perseverance, self-acknowledgment, and the joy of collaborative problem-solving.
