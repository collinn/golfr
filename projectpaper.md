# Introduction

The effective management of student group assignments is a critical component of
contemporary educational practice, particularly in courses where collaboration
enhances the learning experience.
This project addresses the development of an R package designed to automate the
iterative assignment of students into groups, with specific emphasis on optimizing
group dynamics and ensuring fair participation.
Our primary research objective is to create a tool that simplifies and streamlines
the process of forming student groups.

The motivation for this project stems from the observation that many faculty
members find it easier to teach class material and facilitate student learning
through group activities rather than individual assignments.
Group work fosters collaboration, critical thinking, and peer learning,
making it an essential pedagogical strategy.
However, the manual process of assigning students to groups can be cumbersome
and inefficient, particularly as class sizes increase.
An automated solution not only saves time but also ensures that groups are formed
systematically, considering various constraints and preferences.

The program is closely related to the social golfer problem, a well-known combinatorial
problem in mathematics and computer science. [1]
The social golfer problem asks how a given number of golfers can be arranged into
groups of a specific size over multiple rounds, such that no golfer is grouped
with the same golfer more than once. [1]
Solving this problem presents significant challenges due to the complexity of
ensuring that all constraints are met while optimizing for minimal repetition of 
groupings. 

Our project draws inspiration from this problem, aiming to develop a practical tool
that can be used by educators to manage student group assignments effectively.
By leveraging the principles underlying the social golfer problem, we seek to create
a robust and flexible package that accommodates various grouping requirements and
enhances the overall educational experience.
